#PEER UP
Empowering Local Communities: Share, Invest, Thrive. Peer Up: Decentralized resource sharing, P2P tools & equipment lending, yield farming, activism, and governance.

## Technologies we used / sponsors

### AAVE
Communitty funds are deployed on AAVE to earn yield for their local urban investments.

### GHO
GHO is the token of choice for collateral and communitty treasury. 

### Optimism
We deployed the whole solution on optimisim to be user friendly and be able to deploy efficient treasury strategies

And deployed our subgraph there

### ZK Sync Era
Smart wallet (AA) implementation for lending and borrowing market so we automize the collateral holding and disbursement for user 
And deployed our subgraph there

### Graph
All activity on our platform is indexed using new graph (Optimism and ZKsync) and then we use the data for trigering actions in the smart wallet and  all front end dynamic information

### Gnosis / Gateway RPC
We are using gnosis/gateway RPC for all communication with blockchain (ZK Sync, Optimism)  

### BASE (in progress)
Our marketplace enable creators to borrow from each other expensive equipment that might otherwise be inaccessible for them

## PEER UP concept 
PEER UP focuses on three main aspects:

1. Sustainable Local Development
2. Carbon Footprint Reduction
3. Improved Quality of Life

PEER UP enables communities to pool resources into a common treasury and automatically earn yield through DeFi strategies. This allows for local investments and ensures continuous improvement of the neighborhood without relying solely on government grants and being subject to their centralized requirements. On top of it when the community holds a large pool of funds in a pool, they will get way better rates for potential borrowing. 

With PEER UP's local marketplace, you can lend and borrow tools. Whether you're a creator in need of a professional camera or simply want to fix something at home, you no longer have to buy expensive and environmentally impactful tools. Instead, you can borrow them from your neighbors. Our security deposit system and community arbitration guarantee that your borrowed items will be returned.

PEER UP facilitates connections among people in the neighborhood. Borrowing a camera from a neighbor might lead to a future photoshoot together. Furthermore, if you need a mortgage and lack sufficient funds for a down payment, a high reputation score on PEER UP could potentially allow community micro-credits or even lower the requirement from banks, as you are considered a reliable neighbor.

In addition to resource sharing, PEER UP empowers community members to govern the neighborhood and submit petitions to the government in a private yet verified manner.
